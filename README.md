A machine learning implementation code that uses data for predict new localizations forest fires based on latitude and longitude for last months behaviour!

This ML uses data from the municipality of CÃ¡cere (Mato Grosso, state of Brazil) on the high level of forest fires. This algorithm takes data such as: Wind Speed, Temperature, Firepower, Humidity, Days without rain, Longitude and Latidude and the prediction is for future new fires based on the behavior of recent months.

The prediction will show in terms of latitude and longitude of future locations that could be hit or be the new fire outbreaks.
